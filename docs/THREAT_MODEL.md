# Threat Model

## Overview

This document outlines the threat model for the casino application, identifying potential attack vectors, security controls, and mitigation strategies.

## Application Architecture

```
[Users] -> [Load Balancer/CDN] -> [Web Server] -> [Application] -> [Database]
                                      |              |
                                 [WebSocket]    [Cache/Redis]
```

## Assets

### Primary Assets
- **User Accounts**: Authentication credentials, profile data
- **Game State**: Current game sessions, token balances
- **Application Logic**: Game rules, payout algorithms
- **Configuration**: Database credentials, API keys, certificates

### Secondary Assets
- **Audit Logs**: Transaction history, security events
- **Analytics Data**: User behavior, game statistics
- **Session Data**: Active user sessions

## Threat Actors

### External Threats
- **Script Kiddies**: Automated vulnerability scanning, common exploits
- **Organized Crime**: Advanced persistent threats, financial fraud
- **Competitors**: Industrial espionage, service disruption
- **Nation States**: Advanced attacks, data exfiltration

### Internal Threats
- **Malicious Insiders**: Privilege abuse, data theft
- **Compromised Accounts**: Lateral movement, privilege escalation
- **Third-party Vendors**: Supply chain attacks

## Attack Vectors & Mitigations

### Web Application Attacks

| Threat | CWE | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|--------|-----|--------|------------|------------|
| SQL Injection | CWE-89 | High | Medium | Parameterized queries, input validation |
| XSS | CWE-79 | Medium | High | Content Security Policy, output encoding |
| CSRF | CWE-352 | Medium | Medium | CSRF tokens, SameSite cookies |
| Authentication Bypass | CWE-287 | High | Low | MFA, session management |
| Authorization Flaws | CWE-285 | High | Medium | RBAC, principle of least privilege |
| Injection Attacks | CWE-74 | High | Medium | Input sanitization, safe APIs |

### Infrastructure Attacks

| Threat | Impact | Mitigation |
|--------|--------|------------|
| DDoS | Service disruption | Rate limiting, CDN, auto-scaling |
| Man-in-the-Middle | Data interception | TLS 1.3, certificate pinning |
| Server Compromise | Full system control | Container isolation, minimal attack surface |
| Database Breach | Data exfiltration | Encryption at rest, network isolation |

### Application-Specific Threats

#### Game Manipulation
- **Threat**: Client-side tampering with game logic
- **Impact**: Unfair advantage, financial loss
- **Mitigation**: Server-side validation, encrypted communications

#### Session Hijacking
- **Threat**: Stealing user sessions
- **Impact**: Account takeover
- **Mitigation**: Secure session tokens, IP binding, session timeout

#### Financial Fraud
- **Threat**: Manipulation of token/credit systems
- **Impact**: Financial loss, reputation damage
- **Mitigation**: Transaction logging, anomaly detection, dual approval

#### Data Privacy
- **Threat**: Unauthorized access to user data
- **Impact**: Privacy violation, regulatory penalties
- **Mitigation**: Data classification, access controls, encryption

## Security Controls

### Preventive Controls
- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication and authorization
- Encryption (data in transit and at rest)
- Network segmentation
- Security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)

### Detective Controls
- Security logging and monitoring
- Intrusion detection systems
- Anomaly detection
- Vulnerability scanning
- Penetration testing

### Corrective Controls
- Incident response procedures
- Backup and recovery
- Patch management
- Security updates
- User account lockout

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
1. **Inadequate Input Validation**: Direct path to code execution
2. **Weak Authentication**: Easy account compromise
3. **Insufficient Logging**: Delayed breach detection
4. **Insecure Dependencies**: Third-party vulnerabilities

### Medium Risk Items
1. **Session Management Flaws**: Session hijacking
2. **Information Disclosure**: Data leakage
3. **Business Logic Flaws**: Game manipulation
4. **Configuration Issues**: Misconfiguration attacks

### Low Risk Items
1. **Social Engineering**: Limited technical impact
2. **Physical Security**: Cloud infrastructure protection
3. **Insider Threats**: Access controls and monitoring
